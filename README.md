## Quotations

> I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun.

> Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reflects two major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. Second, we believe that the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual complexity of large software systems.

## Q&A

**What can I find in this repository?**

1. Solutions with thoughts(if any) for all exercises in SICP
2. Code snippets I found interesting or instructive

**Why there are no study notes or summaries?**

Here are the reasons: 

1. I personally hate taking notes.
2. You may misunderstand my notes.

I don't think you'll need my notes, because most of my thoughts have been included in the exercise solutions. After all, to have *your* own thoughts, *you* must read SICP *yourself* and get *your* hands dirty.

**What makes this repo different from others?**

1. Everything used in my solutions would has been covered by the textbook by the time the exercise is given, apart from `newline` and `display`, which are for demonstration purpose only.
2. Some solutions are accompanied by my thoughts, and you may found them helpful or even enlightening.
3. I'm a beginner with no prior experience in functional programming and LISP, so the stuff I write is presumably more beginner-friendly than that written by those seasoned programmers.
4. While this repo is written in English, I, the author and owner, am a Chinese native speaker, which means you can open issues in Chinese, and I'll be glad to answer them.
5. Of course, it's written with <3

**Why use English?**

1. To benefit more people
2. To attract a larger audience
3. To make this repo more consistent with SICP
4. To practice my English writing skills
