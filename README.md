## Q&A

**What can I find in this repository?**

1. Solutions with thoughts(if any) for all exercises in SICP
2. Code snippets I found interesting or instructive

**Why there are no study notes or summaries?**

Here are the reasons: 

1. I personally hate taking notes.
2. You may misunderstand my notes.

I don't think you'll need my notes, because most of my thoughts have been included in the exercise solutions. After all, to have *your* own thoughts, *you* must read SICP *yourself* and get *your* hands dirty.

**What makes this repo different from others?**

1. Everything used in my solutions would has been covered by the textbook by the time the exercise is given, apart from `newline` and `display`, which are for demonstration purpose only.
2. Some solutions are accompanied by my thoughts, and you may found them helpful or even enlightening.
3. I'm a beginner with no prior experience in functional programming and LISP, so the stuff I write is presumably more beginner-friendly than that written by those seasoned programmers.
4. While this repo is written in English, I, the author and owner, am a Chinese native speaker, which means you can open issues in Chinese, and I'll be glad to answer them.
5. Of course, it's written with <3

**Why use English?**

1. To benefit more people
2. To attract a larger audience
3. To make this repo more consistent with SICP
4. To practice my English writing skills
