;;; Exercise 2.15
;;; =============

;; For expressions involving only addition, subtraction, multiplication,
;; and division, I would say Eva Lu Ator is right, because the more times
;; inter-interval operations (i.e. operations between two intervals) are 
;; performed, the more information on precision is lost, and thus the
;; looser the interval would be.
;;
;; However, an "expression" can be any program, making things much more
;; complicated. In fact, the answer greatly depends on what "uses" means
;; in the context and what the range of allowed operations would be.
