;;; Exercise 2.15
;;; =============

;; I would say Eva Lu Ator is right, bacause in all experiments, `par2` 
;; produces higher precision than `par1`. I guess that the reason behind
;; can be concluded as "the fewer time uncertain numbers are repeated, the
;; less uncertainty is introduced, and the higher precision we can get".
